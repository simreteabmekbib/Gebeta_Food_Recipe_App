##Project 2: Ethiopian Food Recipe Website
This website is designed to provide guidance on how to cook any Ethiopian cuisine.  It provides recipes of different Ethiopian dishes and videos on how to make it. Users can search for recipes of foods or drinks by name or ingredient. There will be different classifications of the recipes, such as foods served for lunch/breakfast/dinner, vegan/non-vegan and fast foods. Users can also review a recipe and share their thoughts on one's cooking through a public chat on the website.
Users can register to our website as a chef or simply a member who wants to view recipes. The chefs are going to create recipes and videos which will be sent to the administrator. If the administrator approves, the recipe will be posted to the website.
